# BPI
The tenth International Business Process Intelligence Challenge (BPI) was co-located with ICPM. This challenge provides participants with a real-life event log, and challenges them to analyze these data using whatever techniques available, focusing on one or more of the process ownerâ€™s questions or proving other unique insights into the process(es) captured in the event log.

# Task description 
Based on the log data from the reimbursement process at TU/e the participants had to discover the bottle necks and the ways of their optimisation in the algorythm of requests processing.

# Used approach
Our teem divided the work process with the log data into several steps:
*   Initial logs preprocessing: missing values processing, descriptive statistical measures calculation, outliers detection
*   Time-series analysis: time spent on the different applications types for the whole cycle processing (from the inital request opening till money refund)
*   Tokens replay analysis: comparison of the real logs order with the ideal process order
*   Clustering for the groups of cases based on the calculated featues (number of steps, cycles detected (a-b-a, a-b-a-b, a-b-b and etc), presence of stages using dummy variables)   

# Publication
